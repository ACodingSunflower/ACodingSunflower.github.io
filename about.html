        <p class="paragraph">
            The most beautiful road to travel on is one surrounded by 
            nature with a panoramic view, much like the well known 
            panoramic drive in Mpumalanga. It is a winding road with 
            many unexpected turns. Every hilltop brings forth breath-taking 
            views. This is how my journey to web-dev has been. It was not 
            a linear road, yet it was, and still is, a beautiful road to 
            travel. It took me a while but I have finally found my passion 
            in the tech industry. Problem solving is that treacherous uphill 
            drive that brings forth breath-taking views at the top and what 
            a joy and an adventure it is. My artistic background gives me 
            an edge when it comes to delivering simple yet elegant code. 
            My creativity is an asset when it comes to creatively 
            solving a problem and my attention to detail ensures very 
            little room for bugs. With that being said, if you need a break from 
            coding listen to <a class="music" href="https://hlobeautiful.co.za/" target="_blank">my music.</a>
